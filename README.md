# StorageAndPTC
## Implementation so far:
We have created a GitHub repository, which we have attached to our email as well. This repository includes the packages "PBStorage" and "PTCFramework" which were provided to us, as well as our added package "MyLH", in which we created our LH class. So far, in this class we call CreateStorage (as used in PBStorage), and we've been able to successfully use the Iterators from PTCFramework to scan Emp.txt and write records to our newly created storage. Also, we initialize a LH file - however, the methods associated with maintaining the properties of a Linearly Hashed file (e.g. split chains, etc.) remain to be implemented.
## Future work:
Our LH class is also intended to contain utility methods to write/load a serialized logical-to-physical map file, update PBfile entiry, etc. We estimate that these tasks will take us at least a week to complete.
